g2o_viewer in Ubuntu 14.04
<!--more-->

If you compile source code of `g2o` and install it under Ubuntu 14.04, you will find that the component of `g2o_viewer` won't be installed. The reason is that `g2o` now depends on qt5, but there is only qt4 under Ubuntu 14.04. How can we solve this? I googled a lot and those methods of such as checking out to [commit `8ba8a03f7863e1011e3270bb73c8ed9383ccc2a2`](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/41200084) in which qt4 is g2o's dependency. But I encountered many compiling errors when `make` and it was terminated. It really bothers me.

OK,I want to try another way.If the latest g2o needs qt5, should I install qt5 to the PC? Actually If you update your os to 16.04, there will be no problems. But I use ROS Indigo which should only be installed under 14.04. Unfortunately, it depends on qt4. So I can't just uninstall qt4 and install qt5. I should have them both. Below are the procedures of installing qt5 and having the `g2o_viewer` component.

You can see this blog in this detailed [github issue](https://github.com/RainerKuemmerle/g2o/issues/151#issuecomment-487873085).

## Install QT5

Just go to the official downloading link of the latest open-source [QT](https://www.qt.io/download#section-2).After downloading, just run the `qt*.run` to install QT(don't forget to `chomod +777`). I suggest to install only the Tools and source components.

After installation, you will have both qt4 and qt5. But the `qmake` is still version 4. You should do some changes as the code below:
```shell
sudo mv /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt-default/qtchooser/default.conf /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt-default/qtchooser/default.conf_backup
sudo vim /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/qt-default/qtchooser/default.conf
```
Add the two lines to `default.conf`
```
QT5_INSTALL_PATH_YOU_CHOOSE/VERSION_NUMBER_DIR/gcc_64/bin
QT5_INSTALL_PATH_YOU_CHOOSE/VERSION_NUMBER_DIR/gcc_64/lib
```
Then:
```shell
sudo vim /etc/ld.so.conf.d/qt5_lib.conf
```
Add one line to this `qt5_lib.conf`

```
QT5_INSTALL_PATH_YOU_CHOOSE/VERSION_NUMBER_DIR/gcc_64/lib
```

Then run `sudo ldconfig` to update the lib searching path. Now qt5 is available and if you type `qmake -v` you will get something like below:

```
QMake version 3.1
Using Qt version 5.9.8 in /home/bob/software/qt5/5.9.8/gcc_64/lib
```
Test it : run `qtcreator`. If `qtcreator` can't be launched and you have some errors like below:
```
./qtcreator: symbol lookup error: /home/bob/software/qt5/Tools/QtCreator/lib/Qt/plugins/platforms/../../lib/libQt5XcbQpa.so.5: undefined symbol: FT_Get_Font_Format
```
This is a fatal error. If you can't solve this,then all the programs depend on qt5 won't be launched, including `g2o_viewer`.

I spend a lot of time to solve this, I get nothing worked. Then I have to solve it by myself.

This error indicates that something is wrong with `libQt5XcbQpa.so.5` in `QT5_INSTALL_PATH_YOU_CHOOSE/VERSION_NUMBER_DIR/gcc_64/lib/`. We can `cd` to this directory and run:
```shell
ldd -r libQt5XcbQpa.so.5 | grep freetype
```
and you will have :
```
libfreetype.so.6 => /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libfreetype.so.6 (0x00007f77dfdf1000)
```
I googled and knew it should be something wrong with the version of lib `libfreetype.so.6`. In Ubuntu 14.04, the version of `freetype` is too old. To fix this, you should go to `freetype` [downloading page](https://www.freetype.org/download.html) and unzip the file, install freetype to your PC as the documemtaion said. After this, you will have
```
libfreetype.so
libfreetype.so.6
libfreetype.so.6.17.0
```
in your `/usr/local/lib`.Do as follows:

```shell
sudo mv /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libfreetype.so* TO_SOME_WHERE_F0R_BACK_UP
sudo cp /usr/local/lib/libfreetype.so* /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
```
Now this error should be fixed. We have had the QT5 done. It's time to get `g2o` installed.

## Install g2o

### Install libgql

`g2o_viewer` needs `libQGLViewer`. If you have installed `libqglviewer-dev` before, uninstall it via `sudo apt-get remove libqglviewer*`.

Go to [libqglviewer](http://libqglviewer.com/installUnix.html), download latest version and install it as the documentation said.

**If your compilaton couldn't find libQGLViewer**, you shoud do the following:
Go to the source dirtectory of `g2o`, modify the `FindQGLViewer.cmake`  in `cmake_modules` like below:

```
...
find_library(QGLVIEWER_LIBRARY_RELEASE
##NAMES qglviewer QGLViewer qglviewer-qt5 QGLViewer-qt5
  NAMES qglviewer-qt5 QGLViewer-qt5
...
```

### Modify the CMakeLists.txt of `g2o`

If you just compile g2o, it won't find the QT5 libs. So insert a variable to the `CMakeLists.txt`:
```
# set the Qt5Config.cmake path
set(Qt5_DIR QT5_INSTALL_PATH_YOU_CHOOSE/VERSION_NUMBER_DIR/gcc_64/lib/cmake/Qt5)
```

### Install g2o

```shell
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j8
make install
```
Now g2o is installed. And you can run g2o_viewer.

### Install libqglviewer

Remember that the `libqglviewer-dev` has been removed? We need to reinstall it in order for other programs depending on it.
```shell
sudo apt-get install libqglviewer-dev
```

## Unistallation

If you don't need these anymore.
### Uninstall QT5
```
./QT5_INSTALL_PATH_YOU_CHOOSE/MaintenanceTool
```

### Uninstall libQGLViewer

Go to the build directory adn do:

```
sudo make uninstall
```
Libs of `libQGLViewer` are in `/usr/local/lib`.Header files are in `/usr/local/include/QGLViewer`.
### Uninstall g2o 
If you want uninstall `g2o`, just :

```
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/incude/g2o
sudo rm -rf /usr/local/lib/libg2o*
```
### Uninstall freetype

If yo don't need freetype anymore and want to uninstall the `freetype` you installed, make sure you move the original `libfreetype.so*` back.
```shell
rm -f /usr/local/lib/libfreetype.la
rm -f /usr/local/lib/libfreetype.la /usr/local/lib/libfreetype.so.6.17.0 /usr/local/lib/libfreetype.so.6 /usr/local/lib/libfreetype.so /usr/local/lib/libfreetype.a
rm -rf /usr/local/include/freetype2
rm -f /usr/local/bin/freetype-config
rm -f /usr/local/share/aclocal/freetype2.m4
rm -f /usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/freetype2.pc
rm -f /usr/local/share/man/man1/freetype-config.1

```
